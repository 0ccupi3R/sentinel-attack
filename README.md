Sentinel ATT&CK aims to simplify the rapid deployment of a threat hunting capability that leverages Sysmon and MITRE ATT&CK on Azure Sentinel.

**DISCLAIMER:** This tool is not a magic bullet. It will require tuning and real investigative work to be truly effective in your environment.

### Overview
 Sentinel ATT&CK provides the following:
 - A [dashboard](https://github.com/BlueTeamToolkit/sentinel-attack/blob/master/dashboards/attack_telemetry.json) to monitor execution of ATT&CK techniques 
 - A [Sysmon configuration file](https://github.com/BlueTeamToolkit/sentinel-attack/blob/master/sysmonconfig.xml) mapped to specific ATT&CK techniques  
 - A [Sysmon log parser](https://github.com/BlueTeamToolkit/sentinel-attack/blob/master/parsers/Sysmon-OSSEM.txt) mapped against the [OSSEM](https://github.com/Cyb3rWard0g/OSSEM) data model
 - 117 Kusto [detection rules](https://github.com/BlueTeamToolkit/sentinel-attack/tree/master/detections) mapped against ATT&CK
 - A [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) script to provision a Sentinel ATT&CK test lab in Azure
 - [Hunting Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/BlueTeamToolkit/sentinel-attack/tree/master/hunting/notebooks) and [Azure workbooks](https://github.com/BlueTeamToolkit/sentinel-attack/tree/master/hunting/workbooks) to assist with process drill-down 
 - Guides to help you leverage the materials in this repository

### Usage
